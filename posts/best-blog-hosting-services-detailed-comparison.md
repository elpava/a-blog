### What to Look for in Blog Hosting

When choosing a web host for your blog, you need to keep in mind 3 important factors:

1. **Uptime** – If your website goes down, it hurts your traffic and your reputation. Uptime should be a minimum of 99.94%.
2. **Speed** – You need hosting for your blog that loads quickly, or you’ll lose readers and search engine rankings.
